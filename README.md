## [PROPRIETARY & CLOSED SOURCE]
This repository serves as the official technical landing page and status monitor for the **ASAC Quantum Trading System**. 

### 🛡️ System Core Technology
The ASAC Engine is a high-performance, autonomous trading infrastructure built for the TRON Mainnet. It utilizes a private, multi-layer architecture designed for speed and self-adaptation.

* **ASAK Logic:** Proprietary "Self-Improving" hot-reload architecture.
* **Neural Agents:** Decision-making divided between communication and system management layers.
* **High-Concurrency:** Parallel processing via NVIDIA CUDA kernels.
* **Execution Layer:** Ultra-low latency via LuaJIT integration.

🚀 Partnership & Innovation Sponsorship

ASAC Research Division is actively looking for Innovation Sponsors and Strategic Partners.

We are transitioning into a fully-fledged research and business entity (Poland/UK). If you are an investor looking for cutting-edge quantitative technology or a developer specialized in low-level optimization, we invite you to be part of this innovation.

    Sponsorship: Support the final deployment and infrastructure scaling.

    Collaboration: Specialized consultancy for CUDA/LuaJIT (Strict NDA required).

🛠️ Current Deployment Status: NETWORK INITIALIZATION

The system is ready for full Mainnet operation. We are currently resolving a technical "cold start" hurdle (On-chain Account Activation).

Technical Requirement:
To broadcast the ASAC Engine's address to the Global State Trie, a one-time activation transaction is required.

    Target Address: TWY2xf2aCnBKJuRHn3dnyewePsBz53vB3D

    Required: 1.1 TRX (Network Fee)

Once the address is live, the ASAC Research Division will initiate the first full-scale quantum cycle.
