## Core Architecture

### 1. CUDA Acceleration Layer (GPU-Optimized)
- **NVIDIA CUDA Kernels**: Parallel processing of signals across thousands of GPU cores.
- **Throughput**: 10,000+ transactions/second analysis capability.
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond order placement validation.

### 2. ASAK Logic Engine (Self-Improving Hot-Reload)
- **Adaptive Self-Aware Kernel**: Real-time strategy tuning without code redeploy.
- **Hot-Reload**: Zero-downtime updates in <100ms.
- **Regime Detection**: Automatic strategy selection based on market volatility.

### 3. Execution Layer (LuaJIT + Multi-Agent Neural Network)
- **LuaJIT**: 10-100x faster than interpreted Lua for critical order sequences.
- **Neural Agents**: Divided between Communication (Market feeds) and System Management (Consensus).
